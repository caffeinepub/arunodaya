  "summary": "REQ-6 appears implemented via updated meta description and jewellery-themed favicon while keeping title “Arunodaya”. REQ-7 is partially evidenced by updated hero badge/icons (Gem/Sparkles/Heart). REQ-5 is only partially evidenced: jewellery-focused hero copy and updated nav/CTA labels are shown, but working anchor targets for CTAs are not evidenced (at least one CTA is a plain Button without a link).",

      "requirement": "Navigation and CTA button labels are updated to match a jewellery context, and their anchor targets still work on the page.",
      "reason": "The navigation links use anchors (#home, #about), but the ‘Browse Collection’ CTA in the header is a Button with no href/anchor target shown in the diff. The hero CTAs (‘Explore Collection’, ‘Book Appointment’) are also shown as Buttons without evidence of anchor targets. This does not meet the requirement that CTA anchor targets still work on the page.",
