# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reposition the Arunodaya landing page to a jewellery-focused use case by updating copy, navigation/CTAs, metadata description, and visual icon cues while keeping the name “Arunodaya” and the existing theme styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Update landing page header/hero/sections text to explicitly reference jewellery (e.g., fine/handcrafted jewellery, designs, craftsmanship) in English.
- Rewrite the “Something Amazing is Coming” section to describe upcoming jewellery-related offerings (e.g., new collections, custom orders, certifications/craftsmanship, appointments) without adding e-commerce functionality.
- Adjust navigation and CTA labels to fit the jewellery context (e.g., “Browse Collection”, “Book Appointment”, “Get Updates”) while keeping anchor links working.
- Update `frontend/index.html` meta description to describe Arunodaya as jewellery-focused while keeping the page title as “Arunodaya”.
- Replace non-jewellery icons used in hero badges/feature cards with jewellery-appropriate icons (e.g., gem/diamond/ring) and ensure no broken imports.

**User-visible outcome:** The site reads and looks like a jewellery brand landing page (with jewellery-specific messaging, CTAs, metadata, and icons) while retaining the Arunodaya name and overall styling.
